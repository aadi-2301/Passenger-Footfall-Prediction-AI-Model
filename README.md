# Passenger Footfall Predictor AI Model for airport

The model used in this project is Linear Regression. Linear Regression analyzes the historical passenger numbers and identifies the general direction or trend in the data. It then draws the best-fit straight line through these past values. Once the trend line is learned, the model extends this line forward to estimate future values. Therefore, it is used to predict the number of passengers for upcoming months based on previous monthly traffic patterns.
